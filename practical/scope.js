/**
 * Use var when:
Youâ€™re working with older JavaScript code that uses var
You need to declare a variable that has function-level scoping
You want to declare a variable that can be hoisted to the top of its scope

Use let when:

You need to declare a variable that has block-level scoping
You want to declare a variable that cannot be hoisted to the top of its scope
You need to reassign the value of a variable

Use const when:

You need to declare a variable that has block-level scoping
You want to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned after it is declared
You want to ensure that an object or array cannot be modified
